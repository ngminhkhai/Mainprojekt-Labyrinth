# Mainproject-Labyrinth

Labyrinth is a 2D-Top-Down Multiplayer-Game (via LAN), where you're spawned in an labyrinth with all of you're friends. The first one to escape is the winner. You can play with up to 6 people or AI-Players to make things more fun.

How to Play:
  Open one Server.exe. (If you choose to play on multiple PCs, choose only one to start the server on.)
	Open multiple Client.exe, if you're playing on one pc it's best if you have one client that you can controll on you're own and multiple AI-Players, which move on their own. If you choose to have multiple non-AIs, you can controll only one at a time. 
	If you're logged in and choose the level to play, you can move with the arrow keys to find you're way out.
